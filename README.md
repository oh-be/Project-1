Is pollution correlated with climate change
how CO2 directly impacts temperature. 
historical global model
temperature rise we are seeing in regions accross the globe
what countries are polluting/fires/drought the most and does this correlate with weather
  CO2 in region and was there a correlation
what would the temperature be without human activity?
