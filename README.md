* Omar Bernal
* Emily Hurst
* Hamilton Cha
* Keith Moravec
* Victoria Barbosa
---    
### Topic: Is Climate Change Real and is correlated with atmospheric C02 concentration?

### Data Sources

> APIs:  
* https://temperature.global/
* https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902061-climate-data-api
* https://www.programmableweb.com/api/global-warming-carbon-dioxide-co2-atmosphere-concentration-rest-api-v10
 - since 2010 UN Data for CO2 emmissions (file sent from Emily)
---

* Omar (C) = Historic weather change data
* Hamilton = C02 levels in major cities (urban and rural) across date range
* Keith = find beta model for CO2 and temperature and project CO2 against time (using standard regression per year plug
* Victoria = Rate of extreme weather resulting from climate change
* Emily = Temperature/Ocean levels in major cities (urban and rural) across date range

### Questions

1. Is pollution correlated with climate change
2. How does CO2 directly impact temperature. 
3. Historical global model
4. Temperature rise we are seeing in regions accross the globe
5. What countries are polluting/fires/drought the most and does this correlate with weather CO2 in region and was there a correlation
6. What would the temperature be without human activity?
7. Does local C02 emissions influence local temperature rise?
